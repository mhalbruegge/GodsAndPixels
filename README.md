# Gods and Pixels

Gods and Pixels is an experimental Unity-based simulation that blends ancient Greek mythological themes with AI-driven characters and events. Watch pixel-art villagers interact, perform daily tasks, and react to dramatic interventions from the godsâ€”like lightning strikes or vulcano explosion.

## Getting started

You need a valid OpenAI Api-token for running the game.
