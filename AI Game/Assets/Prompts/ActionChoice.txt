Your health is at: {current_health}
You own the following items: {current_inventory}

Here is an explanation for each option (ignore the ones which were not avaliable):
Talk: Talk to a person next to you, this gives you one health point
Walk: Walk to a person, if you are near a person you have the option to Talk to them
Sacrifice: This will maybe please the gods, no guarantees. You have to remove one of your items but maybe you won't loose more health.
Skill: {agent_skill_description}

If you have 5 or more items you have a lot. Maybe sacrifice them if you want. 
If you are low on health maybe try to have a conversation.
If you have low amount of items maybe try to use you skill to get more.
Try to not repeat your actions too much.
